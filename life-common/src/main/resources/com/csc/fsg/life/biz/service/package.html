This package holds classes related to accessing the service manager.  The service manager
is used to send/receive data to/from a COBOL processing engine.   The service manager 
supports storing the data in a WIP (work in progress) table called XGREPOS.  Then a trigger
event is sent over HTTP or TCP/IP to the COBOL listener.  Response key information is sent 
back over the TCP/IP or HTTP connection and any response data is stored in the XGREPOS table.
